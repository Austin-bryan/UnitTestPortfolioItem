# CS Portfolio Submission - Software Testing and QA
## Overview
This repository contains artifacts from my coursework in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The included projects demonstrate my ability to design and implement unit tests, apply software testing strategies, and analyze code quality. These projects showcase my skills in ensuring software reliability through structured testing.

## Included Artifacts
* Project One: Contact Service
  * `Contact.java`
  * `ContactService.java`
  * `ContactTest.java`
  * `ContactServiceTest.java`
* Project Two: Summary and Reflection Report
  * `Project 2.pdf`

## Reflections on Software Testing and Development
### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring functionality and security involves rigorous testing and best practices such as:

* Writing unit tests to verify each component functions as expected.
* Implementing input validation to prevent invalid data and potential security vulnerabilities.
* Using exception handling to catch and properly respond to unexpected scenarios.
* Achieving high test coverage to reduce the likelihood of undetected issues.

By applying these methods, I was able to create robust tests that prevented invalid operations while confirming that all requirements were met.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user needs starts with analyzing requirements and defining constraints clearly. In Project One, I ensured that the `Contact` class adhered to strict requirements, such as:

* Limiting the length of names and phone numbers.
* Enforcing unique contact IDs.
* Preventing the creation of invalid contacts.
* By focusing on clear requirements and testing for edge cases, I ensured the system met user expectations.

### How do I approach designing software?
My approach follows a structured methodology:

* **Requirement Analysis:** Defining constraints and expected behaviors.
* **Test-Driven Development** (TDD): Writing unit tests before implementing features.
* **Modular Design:** Keeping components separate for better maintainability.
* **Validation & Error Handling:** Ensuring user inputs and operations are handled safely.

By maintaining a focus on these principles, I designed software that was both functional and easy to test.

## Repository Usage
To view and run the unit tests:

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Austin-bryan/UnitTestPortfolioItem
```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the tests using JUnit.
